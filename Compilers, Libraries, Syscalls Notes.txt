//Notes on System calls and the interaction between standard libraries, system calls, and compilers

1. Standard libraries are defined by organizations and include things that every implementation (aka standard library and compiler) should be able to understand
Example: ANSI C
	-There are a few implementations of C. Most used on in Linux is Glibc. Windows has own implementation.
	-The different implementations all support AT LEAST ANSI C. Glibc also has POSIX stuff added to it
	-Each standard library also has functions and stuff that are not part of the standard

2. What is a library- Basically a collection of definitions of functions and types etc.
Example: mytestlib contains a class called MyTestClass
	class MyTestClass
	   {
		public MyTestFunction
		   {
			Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
		   }
	    }

-In your Main program you would have to include the mytestlib page and you can then call the method
	class TestProgram
	   {
		public main
		   {
			MyTestClass.MyTestFunction
		   }
	   }
-This will print out Hello world to the console.
-In the background the compiler basically makes substitutions-NEED TO RESEARCH THIS MORE

3. System Calls are- NEED MORE RESEARCH
	-Standard libraries usually act as wrappers for the syscalls.
	   Example: Calling fopen() in C will call the open system call in Linux
	-Are they libraries? Where are the system calls kept?
	
4. Compilers are used to translate betweeen languages
	-They are not dependent on any libraries. For example GCC doest not necessarily ONLY support glibc
	-They do have things that are unique to them. AKA that only they support that are not part of Standard
