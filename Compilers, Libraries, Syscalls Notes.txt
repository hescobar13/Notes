//Notes on System calls and the interaction between standard libraries, system calls, and compilers

1. Standard libraries are defined by organizations and include things that every implementation (aka standard library and compiler) should be able to understand
Example: ANSI C
	-There are a few implementations of C. Most used on in Linux is Glibc. Windows has own implementation.
	-The different implementations all support AT LEAST ANSI C. Glibc also has POSIX stuff added to it
	-Each standard library also has functions and stuff that are not part of the standard

2. What is a library- Basically a collection of definitions of functions and types etc.
Example: mytestlib contains a class called MyTestClass
	class MyTestClass
	   {
		public MyTestFunction
		   {
			Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
		   }
	    }

-In your Main program you would have to include the mytestlib page and you can then call the method
	class TestProgram
	   {
		public main
		   {
			MyTestClass.MyTestFunction
		   }
	   }
-This will print out Hello world to the console.
-In the background the compiler basically basically goes from to the thing that you reference. so when you call MyTestClass.MyTestFunction, the compiler goes to that and "asks" what it has to do to execute that method

3. System Calls are- functions provided by the OS to do things on behalf of the user space program. For example I/O
	-Standard libraries usually act as wrappers for the syscalls.
	   Example: Calling fopen() in C will call the open system call in Linux
	-Are they libraries? Where are the system calls kept?
	
4. Compilers are used to translate betweeen languages
	-They are not dependent on any libraries. For example GCC doest not necessarily ONLY support glibc
	-Example: MinGW basically ported GCC and made some changes but use it on Windows to compile the Windows C library
	-They do have things that are unique to them. AKA that only they support that are not part of Standard
	   Example: See https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/34h23df8.aspx and https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-5.3.0/gcc/C-Extensions.html
	   
Compilers don't substitute anything. I was highly confused on this. For example if I call a library function, the compiler won't replace what I wrote with the library function and just keep nesting away like that.... It will look up the library funtion and do whatever that tells it to do, which might be looking at OTHER functions and so on and so on until it completely finishes and returns control to the original function... this might not be a compiler thing, it might be more of a runtime thing
